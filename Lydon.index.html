            The readings, “An Introduction to Critical Cartography” by Jeremy Crampton and John Krygier, coupled with the reading, “Seeing Like a State” by James Scott, brought about notions regarding the study and history of maps and cartography and their forms and meanings behind particular representations as well as ideas revolving around the evolution and desires for particular sets of information, and the best methods in doing so.  

            “An Introduction to Critical Cartography”, discusses the importance of maps and cartography in and of itself, and what maps are at their core.  The argument stands as maps show what people want to show, which isn’t necessarily a complete accurate representation of the given area.  A quote I hear all the time and that resonated with me on this reading is, “history is written by the victors”, which includes maps.  However, with all of that being said, maps and the knowledge and data that goes into the creation of a map have been made public, i.e. GIS.  Maps being intrinsically “active” have added on a new level of “activeness”, which takes away power from the government to a degree and hands it over to the public who can see and make assumptions for themselves from the now published data.  Maps are not meant in a way to be conclusive, but rather challenged and judged on their data and evidence provided.  

            “Seeing Like a State”, I wanted to attempt to draw a conclusion or even a theory based off of the material presented.  This reading discusses the problems with “high modernism levels”, it too seems to draw the conclusion that maps are biased toward their composer or current political leaders.  Maps work to show things that are important at a given time, and disregard other valuable information.  The idea or notion of simplicity was brought up and expressed through the analogy of a forest.  The forest was converted from a polyculture to a monoculture for the sake of simplicity, increased production, and tracking benefits, which worked, but ultimately brought about more risk to the forest itself.  

            “A diverse, complex forest, however, with its many species of trees, its full complement of birds, insects, and mammals, is far more resilient - far more able to withstand and recover from such injuries - than pure stands.”  (21-22)

            I think that based on our past readings and classes this quote can be useful when thinking of a city or neighborhood as a whole.  All peoples and cultures need to be represented as a way to offer equal opportunity and benefits.  A city can not survive or thrive as a monoculture.
